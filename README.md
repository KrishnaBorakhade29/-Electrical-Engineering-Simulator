# Electical Engineering Simulator

The Electrical Engineering Simulator is a C++ project that leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simulate basic electrical circuits and analyze their behavior. This project allows users to design and simulate various electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and power sources, and perform essential circuit calculations like voltage, current, resistance, and power.
## Technologies used : 
C++ , Object Oriented Programming
